# Threshold-Based Classifier and calculator
This code contains the functionality of an interactive calculator that takes input numbers/function and utilizes python math library and built-in functions to produce an output.  The next section is the threshold-based classifier which uses given data points and takes input from the user to establish a threshold classifier to split up the data points to their respective classification groups.  The accuracy of the entered thresholds is then given
