# Neural Network
Created a class in python called NeuralNetwork that is designed to be trained and tested to create a classifier line that best fits the given data points within a given amount of iterations of learning steps.  This method of supervised learning makes the algorithm learn how to classify a point into one of two classification groups based on previous data
